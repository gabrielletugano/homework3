        <p> Howdy y'all! Hi, I'm Gabrielle Tugano, and I’m originally from The Woodlands, Texas. 
            I’m currently a second-year student at Northeastern University on the Boston campus, 
            majoring in Data Science and Business Administration. Although Texas will always be home, 
            I've really enjoyed my time in Boston, exploring the city and embracing the different seasons. 
            Outside of my studies, I love staying active through running, hiking, and Pilates. I also have 
            a passion for fixing vintage cameras and enjoy cooking and baking in my spare time—it’s always 
            fun to try new recipes and create something delicious. I have two pets that keep life interesting: 
            a Lionhead bunny named Moose and a Red Heeler cattle dog named Forest. Both are full of personality 
            and definitely keep me on my toes! Boston has been a great place for me to grow, both academically 
            and personally, and I'm excited to continue exploring everything this city has to offer.</p>
