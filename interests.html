  <h2 class="type1">My Interests are Kind of All Over the Place...</h2f>
  <h3 class="type2">Running</h3>

  <p class="type2">I used to run when I was in high school and only recently got back into it! I'm nowhere near as fast
    as I used to be, but I've been mainly working towards gaining my endurance back. Right now, my favorite place to run
    is the Esplanade because of the gorgeous view of the Charles River. I've also recently signed up for the Bedford, MA 
    half marathon! I decided to train for it because it's supposed to take place on March 16, my
    birthday, and it'd be a great milestone to hit!

    Below you can see a picture of me with my post-run treat, an iced matcha latte from Area Four. There are also some 
    pictures of the Charles River I've gotten mid-run!

  <h3 class="type2">Pilates</h3>

  <p class="type2"> Pilates is a hobby I've also picked up recently. My roommate encouraged me to give it a shot, and
    we've been going once a week together ever since! It's a tough workout and leaves me sore for days on end, but the 
    sense of accomplishment I feel after each class keeps me coming back!

    of the studio itself!</p>
